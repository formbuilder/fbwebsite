Remaining Features

There are three remaining features that FormBuilder supports which we
haven't reviewed yet:
<ul>
    <li>Templates</li>
    <li>Multi-screen Applications</li>
    <li>Customizable, multilingual messages</li>
</ul>
Whether or not you have use for these features really depends on your
application. Templates can be a big win if you need precise HTML layout,
as production websites often do. FormBuilder provides native support 
several major CPAN template engines, as well as an easy interface to
plug in your own adapter.
<p>
Multi-screen applications are common in many instances, such as checkout
programs, and FormBuilder provides easy hooks for them using the
included <code>CGI::FormBuilder::Multi</code> module.
<p>
Finally, if you want to customize basically every message FormBuilder
outputs, including all the Javascript alerts and predefined text, you can.
<p>
Let's look at each in turn.
