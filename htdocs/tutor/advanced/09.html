Multi-Screen Apps 3

Now onto the other alternative:
<ol>
    <li value=2>Create a single <code>$form</code> object, and get to the
        other params with <code>$form->cgi_param</code>
</ol>
This is useful if you are writing a component that needs to do a couple
different things, such as add, edit, and delete all in one. For example,
it is usually easier to write a single component that does these three
things, even if you are using the multi-component methodology.
<p>
Here is an example that combines just the add, edit, and delete functions
for an online calendar. The display, search, and other functions would
be in separate components:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

# editappt.pl - add, edit, or delete appointments in the calendar

<b>use strict;       # recommended but not required</b>

use CGI::FormBuilder;

# create form at top
my $form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
                fields => [qw/apptid apptname username location comments/],
                <b>header => 1,            # always send header</b>
                <b>keepextras => 1         # keep action param</b>
           );

<b>$form->field(name => 'apptid', static => 1);        # can't edit appt</b>

<b>my $action = $form->cgi_param('action') || 'add';   # what to do</b>

if ($action eq 'add') {
    # Add new appt
    if ($form->submitted && $form->validate) {
        if ($form->submitted eq 'Cancel') {
            # do nothing
            print $form->confirm(text => "Nevermind, canceled request\n");
        } else {
            # create new appt
        }
    } else {
        # Print add form
        print $form->render(<b>submit => [qw/Add Cancel/]</b>);
    }

} elsif ($action eq 'edit') {
    # Edit or delete appt
    if ($form->submitted && $form->validate) {
        if ($form->submitted eq 'Cancel') {
            # do nothing
            print $form->confirm(text => "Nevermind, canceled request\n");
        } elsif ($form->submitted eq 'Delete') {
            # delete appt
        } else {
            # update appt
        }
    } else {
        # Editing, so should have specified an apptid
        my $apptid = $form->field('apptid') || die "No apptid for edit";
        
        # Do a database select
        my $apptref = $sth->selectrow_hashref("select * from db
                                               where apptid = '$apptid'");

        # Print edit form
        print $form->render(<b>submit => [qw/Update Delete Cancel/]</b>,
                            <b>values   => $apptref</b>);
    }
}
</pre>

As you can see, the same form is used for both screens. The only differences
are (a) the edit screen is pre-filled with default <code>values</code> and
(b) the add and edit screens have different buttons at the bottom. Notice how
we exploited options to <code>render()</code> to make this happen.
