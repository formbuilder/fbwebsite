Multi-Screen Apps 2

This section will examine the first alternative:
<ol>
    <li>Create a separate <code>CGI.pm $query</code> object, use
        it to get your params, and then create your <code>$form</code>
        objects with the <code>params</code> option.
</ol>
If you remember way back from the Basic tutorial, we already outlined
pretty much how to do this in the "Custom Headers" section. Let's
assume that the parameter is called <code>mode</code>. The only
extra option we have to add is called <code>keepextras</code>, which
will maintain non-field params as hidden fields across submissions.
Otherwise, our <code>mode</code> will seem to magically "disappear"
when we submit the form:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

# article.pl - show, add, edit, delete online articles

<b>use strict;       # recommended but not required</b>

use CGI;
use CGI::FormBuilder;

<b>my $query = new CGI;                            # OO style</b>
<b>my $mode  = $query->param('mode') || 'show';    # get the mode</b>

if ($mode eq 'show') {
    # Show existing article
    my $article = $query->param('article_id');


} elsif ($mode eq 'new') {
    # New article
    my $form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
                    fields => [qw/title author post_date summary
                                  details city country/],

                    <b>params => $query,           # params from CGI.pm</b> 
                    <b>keepextras => 1             # keep mode param</b> 
               );

    if ($form->submitted && $form->validate) {
        # post new article
    } else {
        print $form->render(template => '/templates/new_article.tmpl');
    }

} elsif ($mode eq 'edit') {
    # Edit article ...


} elsif ($mode eq 'delete') {
    # Delete article ...


}
</pre>

This code example could go for pages and pages. Basically, each <code>elsif</code>
statement is its own component. The components are switched between with the
special <code>mode</code> parameter.  Inside each component, a separate <code>$form</code>
object is created to allow us to customize the fields and templates for each action.
<p>
You'll find this type of methodology most useful in applications like this one
or in Apache <code>mod_perl</code> modules. In <code>mod_perl</code> modules, it's
often easiest to have a different sub for each mode, and then the main <code>handler</code>
sub simply redispatches. Each action sub would generate its own <code>$form</code>
and output.
