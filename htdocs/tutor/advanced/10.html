Custom Messages

The last topic we'll cover is custom messaging. Most of the time,
the built-in FormBuilder messages are sufficient. However, you may be
writing a multi-lingual application, or something else that requires precise
control over messages.
<p>
FormBuilder's messaging system is very easy to understand. Each message
is given a unique tag by FormBuilder. For example, the message that is
used in a JavaScript alert about an invalid select list is called
<code>js_invalid_select</code>. 
<p>
Each message you want to customize is specified to the <code>messages</code>
parameter to <code>new()</code>, along with what you want the message
to say:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI::FormBuilder;

$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             fields => [qw/name email phone/],
             <b>messages => {
                js_invalid_start  => 'There were %s errors found:',
                js_invalid_text   => '- The "%s" field was invalid',
                js_invalid_end    => 'For more help, click the "Help" button',
                form_invalid_text => 'This field is missing or invalid',
             }</b>
        );

print $form->render(header => 1);
</pre>

Alternatively, you can put these specifications in a separate file,
one per line, separated by a space between them:

<pre>
#
# messages.en - messages for English
#
js_invalid_start    There were %s errors found:
js_invalid_text     - The "%s" field was invalid
js_invalid_end      For more help, click the "Help" button
form_invalid_text   This field is missing or invalid
</pre>

(Note: You do not use quotes or commas in this file.)

Then, you simply specify the filename to your form:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI::FormBuilder;

<b>$lang = $ENV{HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE} || 'en';      # language</b>

$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             fields => [qw/name email phone/],
             <b>messages => "messages.$lang",       # messages file</b>  
        );

print $form->render(header => 1);
</pre>

FormBuilder will issue a warning if it can't open the specified
filename, and then will continue using the default messages. Any
messages not explicitly specified will remain the same as the defaults.
