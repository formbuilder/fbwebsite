Summary

In this final tutorial, we discovered:
<ol>
    <li>The remaining big features of FormBuilder</li>
    <li>How to enable templates using the <code>template</code>
           option to <code>new()</code></li>
    <li>How to use basic <code>HTML::Template</code> features</li>
    <li>How to use advanced <code>HTML::Template</code> features</li>
    <li>The fundamentals of <code>Template Toolkit</code> with FormBuilder</li>
    <li>That <code>render()</code> can accept the same options as <code>new()</code>
    <li>Two different methods for multi-screen applications in FormBuilder</li>
    <li>How to write a single, master application in FormBuilder by
        using a separate <code>CGI.pm $query</code> object</li>
    <li>How to write a smaller, multi-mode application by using
        the <code>$form->cgi_param</code> method</li>
    <li>How to customize all the messages that FormBuilder uses
        with the <code>messages</code> option</li>
</ol>
Believe it or not, there is still a lot of untapped power in FormBuilder
that even these 3 tutorials haven't covered. There are lots more options
you can specify to all of the functions covered, each of which tweaks
FormBuilder slightly. If you're ever in need of a feature, try locating
it in the following way:
<ol>
    <li>Determine if it's a field or form related issue</li>
    <li>Look at the appropriate documentation for either
        <a href="/docs/?jump=field()">field()</a> or
        <a href="/docs/?jump=new()">new()</a>, respectively</li>
    <li>Try using the appropriate option and see what happens! :-)</li>
</ol>
I've tried my best at providing an easy-to-follow introduction to
FormBuilder. If you'd like to send me suggestions or comments on
FormBuilder, please <a href="/contrib/author.pl">contact me</a>.
