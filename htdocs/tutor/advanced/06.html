Exploiting render()

So far, we have only seen one option to <code>render()</code>, the
<code>header</code> argument used to turn headers on or off. 
However, <code>render()</code> is much more powerful and accepts
many more options.
<p>
In fact, <code>render()</code> will accept <i>the exact same options
as new().</i> This means that you can specify some options to
<code>new()</code>, and others to <code>render()</code>, depending
on what you're trying to do. 
<p>
Here's a brief example of how this might come in handy:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI::FormBuilder;

$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             method => 'post',
             fields => [qw/name email mlist/],
        );

$form->field(name => 'mlist', options => [qw/Yes No/],
             value => 'Yes');

if ($form->submitted) {
    # you would write code here to act on the form data
    print $form->confirm(<b>template => 'email_success.tmpl'</b>);
} else {
    print $form->render(<b>template => 'email_form.tmpl'</b>)
}
</pre>

In fact, there are other important uses of this flexibility with
multi-screen applications, as we'll see next.
