Multi-Screen Apps

There are a couple different web design schools of thought. One school
believes that you should create a separate script for every component
of your site. That is, if you had a message board, you might have
scripts called <code>newmesg.pl, editmesg.pl, viewmesg.pl, delmesg.pl</code>,
and so on. Using FormBuilder with this methodology is simple - you would
just create a separate <code>$form</code> object in each component.
<p>
Another school of thought believes that you should instead just
place all of your code in a single script, and use a separate CGI
parameter named something like <code>mode</code> or <code>action</code> to
tell you what to do. The advantage of this method is that you only have to
import your modules, connect to your database, and so forth in one
central place.
<p>
If you want to use this methodology, FormBuilder can handle it as well.
You have two options:
<ol>
    <p><li>Create a separate <code>CGI.pm $query</code> object, use
           it to get your params, and then create your <code>$form</code>
           objects with the <code>params</code> option.

    <p><li>Create a single <code>$form</code> object, and get to the
           other params with <code>$form->cgi_param</code>.
</ol>
Which way you go depends on one factor: Whether or not your different
application screens require different fields. If so, then you want
to use the first methodology. Otherwise, use the second one.
<p>
Let's look at each alternative.
