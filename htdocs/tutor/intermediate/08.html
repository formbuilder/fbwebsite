JavaScript Actions 2

We saw earlier how JavaScript actions could be attached to fields by
using <code>jsclick</code>. Similar functionality is provided for your top-level
form as well. Instead of using <code>onSubmit</code>, two other options can be
specified to <code>new()</code>:
<ul>
    <li><code>jsfunc</code> - JavaScript code placed inside FormBuilder's validate function
    <li><code>jshead</code> - JavaScript code placed inside <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
</ul>
Let's look at how each is used.
<p>
In our preceding example, we wanted to change how we validate the form 
depending on what submit button was clicked. It would be nice if we could skip validation
entirely if the user hits "Cancel", and it would also be nice to pop up a special
confirmation box if the user hits "Delete", to prevent accidents. No problem:

<pre>
$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             method => 'post',
             fields => \@fields,
             submit => [qw/Update Delete Cancel/],
             reset  => 0,         # turn off reset button
             <b>jsfunc => &lt;&lt;EOJS

if (form._submit.value == "Delete") {
    if (confirm("Really DELETE this entry?")) return true;
    return false;
} else if (form._submit.value == "Cancel") {
    return true;    
}

EOJS</b>
        );
</pre>

The value of the submit button is held in the special field
<code>form._submit.value</code>. If the user clicks "Delete",
then a dialog box will pop up, asking them to confirm their
selection. If they hit "Ok", then it will <code>return true</code> (skipping
validation). Otherwise, it will <code>return false</code> (failing validation).
<p>
If the user hits "Cancel", then it will again <code>return true</code>,
skipping all validation. The JavaScript you specify to <code>jsfunc</code>
is inserted <i>before</i> FormBuilder's generated JavaScript, so
controlling validation is easy:
<ul>
    <li>To fail validation, preventing submit: <code>return false</code>
    <li>To skip all validation, allowing submit: <code>return true</code>
    <li>To allow validation to proceed normally: do nothing
</ul>
You should view <a href="/ex/multiple_submits.pl" onClick="miniwin(this)">this script in action</a>,
to get a better feel for how this works. Make sure to <a href="/ex/source.pl?f=multiple_submits.pl"
onClick="miniwin(this)">view the HTML source</a> as well.
<p>
The <code>jshead</code> option really deserves little mention. This allows
you to insert arbitrary JavaScript code into the start of your document.
However, FormBuilder will not call this code ever, so it's rarely useful.
