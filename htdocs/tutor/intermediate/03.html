Default Values

Intelligent handling of defaults is another one of FormBuilder's real
strengths. It's another painful task that FormBuilder makes very easy.
<p>
Let's assume you want to create a form that allows a customer to update
their contact information, as basically every company must do. This info
is stored in a database, and you want to create an easy interface to it.
<p>
Doing so is easy:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use DBI;
use CGI::FormBuilder;

$user = $ENV{REMOTE_USER};        # from .htaccess
$dbh  = DBI->connect(...);        # your db here
$sth  = $dbh->prepare("select * from pers where user = $user");
<b>$defs = $sth->fetchrow_hashref;</b>

@fields = qw(first_name last_name email phone
             address city state zip mail_list);

$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             method => 'post',
             fields => \@fields,
             <b>values => $defs,     # values from hashref</b>
             required => 'ALL'
        );

<b># Setup attributes for some fields</b>
$form->field(name => 'state', options => \@states);
$form->field(name => 'zip', size => 10, maxlength => 10);
$form->field(name => 'mail_list', options => [qw/Yes No/]);

# No confirmation to demonstrate stickiness
print $form->render(header => 1);
</pre>

By adding the <code>values</code> option, FormBuilder will walk the
hashref specified, search it <i>case-insensitively</i> for matching fields,
and automatically populate your form. The correct <code>select</code>
options will be selected, <code>checkbox</code>es checked, and so on.
<p>
You should really <a href="/ex/default_values.pl" onClick="miniwin(this)">see this in action</a>
before continuing. Notice how the CGI values override the defaults from
the database across multiple submissions.
