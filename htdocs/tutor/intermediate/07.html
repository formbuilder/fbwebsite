Multiple Submits

Multiple "Submit" buttons are a handy feature that can really simplify an
interface. For example, you may be writing a form that allows people to
add and remove records from a database. Rather than write multiple apps,
it is often easier for everyone if a single screen shows the item, along
with "Update", "Delete", and "Cancel" buttons along the bottom.
<p>
The problem is, how do you tell which one the user clicked? Unfortunately
this is problematic, because browsers suck.
<p>
FormBuilder works around this problem with some JavaScript magic<sup><small>TM</small></sup>.
This allows you to reliably tell which button the person clicked on. Getting
to this information is easy - it's returned from the same <code>submitted()</code>
function we saw early on.
<p>
To create a form with multiple submit buttons, all you have to do is specify
an arrayref to the <code>submit</code> option. You may also want to turn
off the <code>reset</code> button to prevent confusion:

<pre>
$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             method => 'post',
             fields => \@fields,
             <b>submit => [qw/Update Delete Cancel/],
             reset  => 0,         # turn off reset button</b>
        );
</pre>

Getting to the submission mode is easy, just use <code>submitted()</code>:

<pre>
<b>if ($form->submitted eq 'Update' && $form->validate) {
    # code to update record
 
} elsif ($form->submitted eq 'Delete') {
    # code to delete record

} elsif ($form->submitted eq 'Cancel') {
    # do nothing
</b>
} else {
    print $form->render(header => 1);
}
</pre>

There you have a single-screen application that handles the whole process.
Note that we only use <code>validate()</code> against the "Update" submit
mode, for reasons explained below.
<p>
If you were to write an application like this and were using input validation, you
would notice one annoying thing. Since FormBuilder has no idea what your different
submit buttons are supposed to do, it will generate JavaScript that will try to validate
your form fields on every submission. However, you really don't want to have to enter
valid data just to "Cancel" and do nothing. Keep reading...
