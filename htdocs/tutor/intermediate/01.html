Trickier Forms

Time to get down and dirty.
<p>
Sooner or later, you'll probably run into a situtation that requires you do some tricky
stuff with your forms, like:
<ul>
    <li>Import defaults into your fields from an outside source, such as a database
    <li>Add JavaScript event handlers like <code>onClick</code> and <code>onChange</code>
    <li>Make use of custom input validation with homegrown regexps
    <li>Use several different Submit buttons, and change what you do depending on
        which one the user clicked
    <li>Use FormBuilder in concert with other CGI modules, such as <code>CGI.pm</code>
</ul>
