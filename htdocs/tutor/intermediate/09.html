Modules & mod_perl

FormBuilder is designed to work well alone, alongside other modules, or
even in a <code>mod_perl</code> environment. FormBuilder is written under
<code>use strict</code> and is completely <code>mod_perl</code> safe.
<p>
The key to interacting with any of these situations is the <code>params</code>
option to <code>new()</code>. We discussed this before, in the section on
"Custom Headers". By default, FormBuilder assumes it has complete control
of the CGI environment, and will create its own instance of <code>CGI.pm</code>
to manage it.
<p>
However, when you're already using <code>CGI.pm</code> yourself, or running
under <code>mod_perl</code>, this is obviously not true. So, in either of
these situations you need to specify the <code>params</code> option to <code>new()</code>.
<p>
First, using FormBuilder with <code>CGI.pm</code>:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI;
use CGI::FormBuilder;

<b>$query = new CGI;</b>
$form  = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             method => 'post',
             fields => [qw/name email zipcode/],
             <b>params => $query</b>
         );

print $form->render;
</pre>

Second, using FormBuilder under <code>mod_perl</code>

<pre>
package My::Application;    # or whatever

use Apache::Request;
use CGI::FormBuilder;

sub handler {
    <b>my $r = Apache::Request->new(shift);</b>
    my $form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
                    method => 'post',
                    fields => [qw/name email zipcode/],
                    <b>params => $r</b>
               );
    print $form->render;
}
</pre>

In both situations, the only thing that you have to add is the <code>params</code>
option. Everything else about FormBuilder stays the same.
<p>
Finally, note that the <code>params</code> and <code>values</code> options are
separate, and <i>both</i> can be specified. The <code>values</code> option is
designed to provide default values to populate the form with. The <code>params</code>
option changes where to get CGI parameters from. CGI parameters will always
override any default values.
