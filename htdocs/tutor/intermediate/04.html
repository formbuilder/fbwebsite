CGI Stickiness

"Stickiness" is the ability of values to remain filled in across
submissions. Everyone's filled out a form that has an error, and
which must be corrected. In such applications, if they're coded right,
then the fields that have already been filled in remain filled in.
<p>
However, normally this is a big pain for anything other than simple
text fields. Getting a select list to remain sticky is tedious at
the very least, and multiple-select lists are error-prone because
you have to calculate an intersection of the options and values.
<p>
As mentioned before, FormBuilder automatically handles stickiness
for you, overriding any default <code>values</code> you may have
specified, and returning the correct data to you. However, sometimes
you may not want stickiness. For example, you may want to write an
app that allows a person to add multiple entries to a database in
rapid succession. In this case, simply turn stickiness off:

<pre>
$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             fields => \@fields,
             <b>sticky => 0          # not sticky</b>
        );
</pre>

You will still be able to get to what the person entered via the
<code>field()</code> function, but it won't appear in the form
after being submitted.
<p>
On the other hand, you may decide it would be nice to pre-fill
certain fields in a form from an HTML link. For example, if a
person clicks on "Create new membership", you may want to fill
in the name of the site. This is especially useful if you host
several websites and want to use one form.
<p>
This is exceedingly easy in FormBuilder. Since FormBuilder 
automatically handles stickiness, simply list any fields and
values you want filled in via a URL request:

<pre>
http://your-server/subscribe.cgi?site=yoursite.com&bill=monthly
</pre>

Then, assuming that <code>subscribe.cgi</code> had a "site" and
"bill" field in its form, they would be automatically filled in
and/or selected with the specified data.
