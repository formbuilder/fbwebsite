JavaScript Actions

As you've already seen, FormBuilder actually generates tons of JavaScript for
you, for the purpose of client-side form validation. JavaScript has other uses
too, such as causing events to happen when a field is modified.
<p>
If you recall, back when we were talking about field attributes, we mentioned
that any options not recognized by FormBuilder would be passed through to your
HTML tag. So, one could set a JavaScript action like so:

<pre>
$form->field(name     => 'search',
             <b>onchange => 'this.form.submit()'</b>);
</pre>

This will work just fine. But there's actually an even better way to do it.
<p>
Have you ever been annoyed at how the different input fields have different
event handlers? Some are <code>onclick</code>, others are <code>onchange</code>,
and so forth. This isn't the best for code maintenance, since this means you
have to change your JavaScript actions if you update your options.
<p>
Instead, FormBuilder provides an option called <code>jsclick</code>. This is
specified to <code>field()</code>, just like above, with the advantage that
FormBuilder will automatically translate it to the correct action depending
on the type of field:

<pre>
$form->field(name    => 'search',
             <b>jsclick => 'this.form.submit()'</b>);
</pre>

This translates to less code maintenance in the long-run, plus it eliminates
silly errors (such as using <code>onchange</code> for a <code>checkbox</code>).
<p>
It is also possible to specify special form actions, equivalent to <code>onsubmit</code>
but more robust, which are covered just a little later.
