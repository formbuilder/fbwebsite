Input Validation 2

The simple validation with built-in patterns is often all that most
people need. However, occassionally you may run into situations where
you need to specify an exact regular expression, or set of values
which the data must be within.
<p>
Doing so is easy. For each field you list in the <code>validate</code>
option, you can specify the following:
<ul>
    <li>The name of a built-in pattern, as we saw previously
    <li>A custom regular expression, <i>in single quotes</i>
    <li>An arrayref of values, of which the field must be one
    <li>A hashref of JavaScript and Perl-specific validations
</ul>
So, tossing all these together, one could write a validation set
like the following:

<pre>
$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             fields   => [qw/full_name username email dept_num
                             password confirm_password/],
             validate => {
                full_name => '/\w+\s+\w+.*/',
                username  => '/^[a-zA-Z]\w{5,7}$/',
                email     => 'EMAIL',
                dept_num  => [110923, 398122, 918923, 523211],
                password  => '/^[\w.!?@#$%&*]{6,8}$/'
                confirm_password => {
                      javascript => '== form.password.value',
                      perl       => 'eq $form->field("password")'
                }
             }
        );
</pre>
This would create both JavaScript and Perl conditionals on the fly
that would ensure:
<ul>
    <li><code>name</code> is at least 2 words long
    <li><code>username</code> starts with a letter, and is 6-8 characters total
    <li><code>email</code> is a valid email address
    <li><code>password</code> is 6-8 of the specified characters
    <li><code>confirm_password</code> is the same as the <code>password</code> field
</ul>
Remember, <i>any regular expressions you specify must be enclosed in single quotes
because they need to be used for both JavaScript and Perl code.</i>
