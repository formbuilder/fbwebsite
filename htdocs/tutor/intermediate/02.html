Perl References

This really doesn't belong here, but there are very few concise
explanations of references in Perl, and understanding them will
really help you exploit FormBuilder.
<p>
Up until now, we've skirted the idea of references, mentioning
in passing that you should just place a backslash in front of
any arrays or hashes you need to pass into FormBuilder.
<p>
Doing so actually creates a <i>reference</i>. Taking a reference
allows you to pass arrays and hashes around as scalars (singular
values), which is needed in Perl 5 to keep them intact.
In the examples, you've seen something similar to this:

<pre>
@fields = qw(name email);
$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             fields => \@fields
        );
</pre>

Here, <code>\@fields</code> is a reference. Specifically, it's an array
reference, or "arrayref" for short.

Similarly, we can do the same thing with hashes:

<pre>
%validate = (
    name  => 'NAME';
    email => 'EMAIL',
);

$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             fields   => \@fields,
             validate => \%validate
        );
</pre>

Here, <code>\%validate</code> is a hash reference, or "hashref".
<p>
There are two more types of references: "anonymous arrayrefs" and
"anonymous hashrefs". These are created with <code>[]</code> and <code>{}</code>,
respectively. For our purposes, there is no real difference between this code:

<pre>
@fields = qw(name email);
%validate = (name => 'NAME', email => 'EMAIL');

$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             fields   => \@fields,
             validate => \%validate
        );
</pre>

And this code:

<pre>
$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             fields   => [ qw(name email) ],
             validate => { name => 'NAME', email => 'EMAIL' }
        );
</pre>

Except that the latter doesn't require that we first create 
<code>@fields</code> and <code>%validate</code> variables.
<p>
Now back to our regularly-scheduled program...
