Smartness

As we've seen repeatedly, FormBuilder does a lot of stuff for you automatically.
In the majority of cases, this is good, but there may be occassion where
you want FormBuilder to be a little "stupider" and just generate and process
basic HTML and JavaScript.
<p>
This is easy to do, simply tweak the <code>smartness</code> option:

<pre>
$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             fields => \@fields,
             <b>smartness => 0      # dare to be stupid</b>
        );
</pre>

Conversely, there's a whole bunch of stuff that FormBuilder can do but doesn't
by default. For example, FormBuilder can automatically guess at the type of field
something should be, just based on its name. For example, a field including the
regex <code>passw[or]*d</code> would become type <code>password</code>, a field including
the term "comments" could become type <code>textarea</code>, and so on.
<p>
If you want stuff like this, including automatic field validation and options,
turn up the smartness:

<pre>
$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             fields => \@fields,
             <b>smartness => 2      # genius level IQ</b>
        );
</pre>

To see how much stuff this does for you, take a look at this <a href="/ex/form_method_smart.pl"

back in the Basic Tutorial. Make sure to check out the <a href="/ex/source.pl?f=form_method_smart.pl"
onClick="miniwin(this)">HTML source</a> for comparison. (The original script is
