In this section, we learned:
<ol>
    <li>Some of the advanced features FormBuilder supports</li>
    <li>A little bit about Perl array and hash references</li>
    <li>How to populate our form with default values, by using
        the <code>values</code> option to <code>new()</code></li>
    <li>How to add JavaScript actions to fields, by using the
        <code>jsclick</code> option to <code>field()</code></li>
    <li>How to take advantage of the advanced validation supported
        by the <code>validate</code> option.</li>
    <li>How to create a form with multiple submit buttons by
        specifying an arrayref to the <code>submit</code> option,
        and how to get the button that was clicked on by using
        the <code>submitted()</code> function.</li>
    <li>How to specify specialized JavaScript code by using the
        <code>jsfunc</code> option.</li>
    <li>How to use FormBuilder with other modules and under <code>mod_perl</code></li>
</ol>

At this point, you should have a pretty good idea of what FormBuilder
can do. There are still many more options we haven't covered, but these
are a bit more obscure and not used as widely. The only important things
yet to be covered are templates, multi-screen applications, and custom
messages (including multilingual support).
