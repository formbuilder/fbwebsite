Field Attributes

Of course, in addition to options, there are a lot of "little things" one often
has to do to a field, such as changing its length.
<p>
Well, just like changing the form attributes for our <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag,
changing any tag you can think of for a field is done simply by specifying that
tag to the <code>field()</code> method:

<pre>
$form->field(name  => 'first_name',
             type  => 'text',       # default
             <b>size  => 40,
             maxlength => 80</b>);
</pre>

These changes would result in the following HTML tag:

<pre>
&lt;input name="first_name" type="text" size="40" maxlength="80"&gt;
</pre>

In fact, any extra attributes you specify that are not recognized FormBuilder
options will be transferred directly into the HTML tag. This ensures that
FormBuilder will not go out of date when HTML 12.4 comes out.

You can change a couple other things about a field as well:

<pre>
$form->field(name   => 'first_name',
             <b>label  => 'Your First Name',   # override label
             value  => 'anonymous',         # override value
             comment=> '(first and last)'</b>); <b># printed after field</b>
</pre>

You can view the <a href="/docs/?jump=field()">complete documentation
on the field() method</a>, which includes some options we'll look at
a little later.
