Intro to FormBuilder

Welcome to the FormBuilder Tutorial! This step-by-step tutorial will walk you
through the usage of FormBuilder, from basic forms to advanced templates
and multilingual messages. You can read these in series by clicking
on the "Next" and "Previous" links, or skip directly to a topic using
the navbar to the left.

<b>Basics</b>
<p>
FormBuilder is designed to handle all parts of a CGI form request - generation,
submission, and validation. As such, FormBuilder applications will usually
loop back on themselves. That is, you will have a single script that, when
invoked, will take care of your entire application just based on the CGI
parameters.
<p>
FormBuilder uses an Object-Oriented calling-style, but don't let that scare
you away. Usage is exceedingly easy, as there are only a couple functions
you need to know about. Throughout the documentation, our FormBuilder object
will always be identified as <code>$form</code>, and you'll find this works
equally well in your own scripts.
<p>
Here are the basic steps:
<ol>
    <li>Create a <code>$form</code> object with <code>CGI::FormBuilder-&gt;new()</code>
    <li>Define your form fields with the <code>$form-&gt;field()</code> method.
    <li>Check for whether the form was submitted with <code>$form-&gt;submitted</code>,
        and if so, validate it with <code>$form-&gt;validate</code>.
    <li>Get to individual values using the <code>$form-&gt;field()</code>
        method, and do whatever you need to with the data (update a database, etc).
    <li>If the form wasn't submitted (or fails validation), print it out using
        the main <code>$form-&gt;render</code> function.
</ol>
That's all there is to it! FormBuilder will take care of HTML and JavaScript
generation, table layout, validation, stickiness, error messages, and so forth.
Let's look at a basic FormBuilder script.
