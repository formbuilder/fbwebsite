Form Method

By default, FormBuilder sends form data via <code>get</code>, as the
CGI specification states. However, for many types of forms, you want
to send them via <code>post</code>, since this prevents caching and
bookmarking on the client side.
<p>
Doing so is easy, simply change the <code>method</code> in <code>new()</code>:

<pre>
$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(<b>
             method => 'post',</b>
             fields => \@fields,
        );
</pre>

(Note: The order you specify options in never matters to FormBuilder.)
<p>
In fact, you can pass in any valid <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag
attribute and it will go directly into the top of the form:

<pre>
$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(<b>
             method  => 'post',
             name    => 'personal_info',
             enctype => 'multipart/form-data',</b>
             fields  => \@fields,
        );
</pre>

Naming your form with the <code>name</code> option has special
usefulness with multi-screen forms, as we'll see later.
<p>
Finally, note that you can change the <code>action</code> in the same way,
although usually for FormBuilder applications this is not desired (since
FormBuilder handles the entire process).
<p>
Take a minute to play around with this <a href="/ex/form_method.pl" onClick="miniwin(this)">script in action</a>,
and <a href="/ex/source.pl?f=form_method.pl" onClick="miniwin(this)">view the source</a> as well.
