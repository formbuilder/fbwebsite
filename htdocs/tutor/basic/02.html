A Simple Form

A simple FormBuilder application looks like the following:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI::FormBuilder;

@fields = qw(first_name last_name email phone);

$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             fields => \@fields,
        );

if ($form->submitted && $form->validate) {
    # you would write code here to act on the form data
    $fname = $form->field('first_name');
    $lname = $form->field('last_name');

    print $form->confirm(header => 1);
} else {
    print $form->render(header => 1);
}
</pre>


First, we define our fields, and create a new <code>$form</code>
object specifying those fields (we have to backslash our <code>\@fields</code>
array so that it's passed in one piece). FormBuilder then takes them, creates
human-readable labels for each field, and lays everything out in an
HTML table automatically via the <code>$form-&gt;render</code> method.
In fact, FormBuilder even titles the name of the form based on the
name of the script! (<code>personal_info.pl</code> becomes "Personal Info").
<p>
When the user hits the "Submit" button, <code>$form-&gt;submitted</code>
will return true, which in our example above would also cause
<code>$form-&gt;validate</code> to execute (due to the <code>&&</code> in
the <code>if</code> statement). If both return true, it means valid form data
was submitted, and you can then do whatever you need to do with that data.
<p>
Getting to the form data is as easy as using the <code>field()</code>
method in a way similar to <code>CGI.pm</code>'s <code>param()</code>
function. The <code>field()</code> function has numerous other
uses too, as we will see later.
<p>
Stop for a second and <a href="/ex/simple_form.pl" onClick="miniwin(this)">see this in action</a>.
Then, check out the <a href="/ex/source.pl?f=simple_form.pl" onClick="miniwin(this)">HTML generated</a>
by this application before going on to the next step.
