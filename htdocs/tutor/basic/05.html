Field Options

By default, all fields are of type <code>text</code>, again, just
like the HTML spec says. This has worked so far, but often you'll
want a <code>select</code> list, set of <code>checkbox</code>es, etc.
<p>
This is one area where FormBuilder really shines: <b>input field
abstraction</b>. Make sure you understand this next part.
<p>
FormBuilder maintains all form fields as data entities. Not
"checkboxes", but <i>fields</i>. FormBuilder will actually
decide for you what the best HTML representation is based
on the number of <i>options</i> a field has. When a field has
no options (the default case), then the field is a simple
<code>text</code> input. The more options you specify,
the more extensive the representation to the user.
<p>
To change the number of options, you use the <code>field()</code>
method. Remember earlier when we mentioned it had a number of
uses? Any time you want to change an individual field's properties,
you use <code>field()</code>. For example:

<pre>
@options = qw(Subscribe Unsubscribe);
$form->field(name => 'mailing_list',
             <b>options => \@options</b>);      <b># add options</b>
</pre>

Here, we've given the <code>mailing_list</code> field two options:
"Subscribe" or "Unsubscribe". Since there are only two options,
they will be presented in a <code>radio</code> group, like so:

<pre>
&lt;input name="mailing_list" type="radio" value="Subscribe"&gt; Subscribe 
&lt;input name="mailing_list" type="radio" value="Unsubscribe"&gt; Unsubscribe
</pre>

FormBuilder is smart enough to automatically change the HTML
representation from <code>text</code> to <code>radio</code>,
just because it sees options for the field! And if you were
to specify several more options, it would automatically change
the field to a <code>select</code> list. Finally, a single-option
list will become a <code>checkbox</code>, since this allows the
user to deselect it.
<p>
While FormBuilder does all this for you, if you want to force
something to be a specific HTML input type, you can do so very
easily. Simply specify the <code>type</code> argument to <code>field()</code>:

<pre>
$form->field(name => 'mailing_list',
             <b>type => 'select'</b>,
             options => \@options);
</pre>

This would force <code>mailing_list</code> to be represented as
a <code>select</code> list. Before you do this, though, I encourage you to play
around with FormBuilder's "smartness" a little, you just may like it. :-)
<p>
Regardless, in all cases you get to the data the exact same way:

<pre>
$mlist = $form->field('mailing_list');
</pre>

FormBuilder addresses all data as fields - it doesn't care if something's
a select list, textarea, or file upload. Getting to the data is always
done the same way.
