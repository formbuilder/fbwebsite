Field Data

As we mentioned, the standard way to get at field data is by using the
<code>field()</code> option along with the name of the field you want, very similar to how
<code>CGI.pm's param()</code> works:

<pre>
$email = $form->field('email');    # get "email" field
</pre>

In the case of multiple values (for example from a multiple <code>select</code>
list), you can get all the values back simply by requesting an array:

<pre>
@favorites = $form->field('favorite_colors');
</pre>

In addition, there are a couple other things you can do. First, you can get a
list of all field names by calling <code>field()</code> without any options
in an array context:

<pre>
<b>@fields = $form->field;</b>
for (@fields) {
    # debug field values, the join handles multi-valued fields
    warn "Value of field '$_' = " . join(',',  $form->field($_));
}
</pre>

Second, and perhaps most useful, you can get all of the fields returned as
a hashref if you call <code>field()</code> without any options in a scalar
context:

<pre>
<b>$field = $form->field;           # hashref</b>
warn "email = $field->{email}";
warn "mlist = $field->{mlist}";
</pre>

The advantage to this last method is that you can use it directly in strings,
and it's much quicker than a function call. The disadvantage is it will only
return the first value of a field, so won't work for any fields that are multi-valued.
(Note: If you don't know what a hashref is, don't worry, we'll discuss it in the
Intermediate Tutorial.)
<p>
<b>Important:</b> In <i>all</i> cases, you will <i>only</i> be able to access those fields
that you have explicitly defined via the <code>fields</code> option to <code>new()</code>.
FormBuilder intentionally ignores any parameters not listed as valid fields for security
reasons. To get to extra CGI parameters, you must use the <code>cgi_param()</code> function:

<pre>
<b>$company = $form->cgi_param('company');</b>
</pre>

This could be useful if you wanted to do rebranding of a website. For example,
if a person went to <code>http://hr-outsourcing.com/form.pl?company=mr_propane</code>, a
different header may appear. However, you would not want this as a form field, since it would
not be user-modifiable.
