Custom Headers

If you've been paying attention, you've noticed that all of our
<code>print</code> statements have specified the <code>header</code>
option:

<pre>
if ($form->submitted) {
    print $form->confirm(header => 1);
} else {
    print $form->render(header => 1);
}
</pre>

This automatically generates a CGI header for you, along with some leading
HTML like a title, body tag, and so forth.
<p>
But often, you'll want to include your form as part of a bigger
page, possibly with its own navbar, images, stylesheets, and
so on.
<p>
In this case, you should turn off the <code>header</code> option by
simply omitting it. Then, use some other module to generate your 
header and leading HTML. The only trick you have to remember is that when
you use FormBuilder with other CGI modules, you have to tell it
explicitly where to get the CGI request parameters from by
using the <code>params</code> option:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use CGI;
use CGI::FormBuilder;

@fields = qw(username password confirm_password);

<b>$query = CGI->new;                 # must use OO version</b>
$form  = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
              fields => \@fields,
              <b>params => $query,    # get CGI params from CGI.pm</b>
              font   => 'verdana'
         );

<b>print $query->header;              # use CGI.pm header</b>

# open and print your custom HTML
open H, "&lt;header.html";
print while &lt;H&gt;;
close H;

if ($form->submitted) {
    <b>print $form->confirm;          # no header option</b>
} else {
    <b>print $form->render;           # no header option</b>
}

</pre>

You have to use the Object-Oriented calling style of <code>CGI.pm</code>,
so that FormBuilder can still get to the CGI parameters even after <code>CGI.pm</code>
has already processed them. Don't worry, <code>CGI.pm</code> is still easy to use.
Just prefix your normal calls to CGI functions with the string <code>$query-&gt;</code>.
For example:

<pre>
use CGI qw/:standard/;                # standard

use CGI;                              # 00 form
$query = CGI->new;                    # 00 form

$name = param('name');                # standard
$name = $query->param('name');        # 00 form

print header();                       # standard
print $query->header;                 # 00 form
</pre>

Remember, you <b>only</b> have to do this if you're generating your own
custom headers. In fact, there are even <i>better</i> ways to get the proper
HTML layout using Templates, as we will see in the "Advanced" section.
The above method is easy to use if you're looking for something simple.
