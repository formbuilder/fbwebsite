Multi-Select Lists

In the previous step, we saw how to create single-valued lists. That is,
<code>radio</code> groups and standard <code>select</code> lists. Each
of these allows the user to return a single value.
<p>
To allow a field to return multiple values, all you need to do is specify
the <code>multiple</code> option to <code>field()</code>:

<pre>
$form->field(name     => 'favorite_colors',
             options  => \@colors,<b>
             multiple => 1</b>);
</pre>

This would allow the <code>favorite_colors</code> field to return
one or more of the items from the <code>@colors</code> array, which
are presumably colors.
<p>
Now, what does this mean in terms of our HTML layout? Well, if there
are only 4 or fewer colors, they'll be placed in a checkbox group,
like so:

<pre>
&lt;input name="favorite_colors" type="checkbox" value="Red"&gt; Red
&lt;input name="favorite_colors" type="checkbox" value="Green"&gt; Green
&lt;input name="favorite_colors" type="checkbox" value="Blue"&gt; Blue
</pre>

Checkboxes will allow the user to see all the options, and choose
the ones that they want. (The number 4 was actually picked in response to
some user interface studies done on how many items people can remember.)
<p>
However, if there are more than 4 items, obviously checkboxes will become
too cluttered, so FormBuilder automatically converts the field to a <code>select</code> list:

<pre>
&lt;select name="favorite_colors" multiple&gt;
&lt;option value="Red"&gt;Red&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="Green"&gt;Green&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="Blue"&gt;Blue&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="Yellow"&gt;Yellow&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="Orange"&gt;Orange&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="Purple"&gt;Purple&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</pre>

Again, all this magic can be overridden. To force a <code>select</code> list
regardless of the number of options, all you have to do is explicitly
specify the <code>type</code>:

<pre>
$form->field(name     => 'favorite_colors',
             <b>type     => 'select',</b>
             options  => \@colors,
             <b>multiple => 1</b>);
</pre>

In all situations, FormBuilder will automatically handle multiple stickiness
correctly. If the person clicks multiple items and the form needs to be
reloaded (as happens when validation fails), the correct items will remain
selected.
<p>
Finally, since these fields can have multiple values, in order to get all
the values accurately, you need to request an array from the <code>field()</code>
function:

<pre>
@favorites = $form->field('favorite_colors');
</pre>

The array <code>@favorites</code> will contain all of the options that
the user selected for that field.
