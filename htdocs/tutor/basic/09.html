HTML Formatting

You'll notice that the forms output thus far are very simple. White
background, black font, generic text. This might've worked back in 1995,
but it's a little boring these days.
<p>
FormBuilder provides you plenty of flexibility to make your forms as
fancy as you want. In fact, there is a whole host of options you can
use to change every part of the HTML formatting:

<pre>
$form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
             fields => \@fields,
             required => 'ALL',     # all fields must be filled in
             <b>font   => 'arial,helvetica',
             title  => 'Personal Information',
             text   => 'Please input your personal info below:',
             lalign => 'right',     # align field labels to right
             table  => {            # change the &lt;table&gt;
                bgcolor => 'gray', 
                border  => 0,
                cellspacing => 0,
                cellpadding => 5,
             },
             body   => {            # change the &lt;body&gt;
                bgcolor => '#3399CC',
                text    => 'white',
                link    => '#CC0000', 
                vlink   => '#CC0000', 
                alink   => '#CC0000', 
             },
        </b>);
</pre>

These are listed in order of decreasing usefulness. That is, in real
life you will probably find yourself wanting to generate your own
HTML header and footer, negating the need to change the body or
even the title. However, the <code>font</code> option is quite
useful, because FormBuilder will automatically generate font tags for
every single table element. <i>(Even better, check out the <code>stylesheet</code> option)</i>

To get a taste of this formatting, <a href="/ex/personal_info.pl" onClick="miniwin(this)">see this in action</a>,
and check out the <a href="/ex/source.pl?f=personal_info.pl" onClick="miniwin(this)">HTML generated</a>.
