NAME
    INSTALL - how to install FormBuilder 3.0

DESCRIPTION
    To install in your root Perl tree:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    If you want to relocate it elsewhere, say for testing, you need to
    change several "MakeMaker" variables:

        perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/lib \
                         INSTALLMAN1DIR=~/man/man1 \
                         INSTALLMAN3DIR=~/man/man3 \
                         INSTALLARCHLIB=~/lib \
                         INSTALLPRIVLIB=~/lib \
                         INSTALLSITELIB=~/lib \
                         INSTALLSITEARCH=~/lib

    Note: This is true for CPAN modules and is not specific to FormBuilder.
