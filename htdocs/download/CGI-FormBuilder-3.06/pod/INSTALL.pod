INSTALL - how to install FormBuilder 3.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To install in your root Perl tree:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you want to relocate it elsewhere, say for testing, you need
to change several C<MakeMaker> variables:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/lib \
                     INSTALLMAN1DIR=~/man/man1 \
                     INSTALLMAN3DIR=~/man/man3 \
                     INSTALLARCHLIB=~/lib \
                     INSTALLPRIVLIB=~/lib \
                     INSTALLSITELIB=~/lib \
                     INSTALLSITEARCH=~/lib

Note: This is true for CPAN modules and is not specific to B<FormBuilder>.
