DESCRIPTION
    FormBuilder is a fully-functional form engine with numerous features. It
    is far more than a form-generating module. For example, you can build a
    complete application with something as simple as this:

        use CGI::FormBuilder;

        # Let's assume we did a DBI query to get existing values
        my $dbval = $sth->fetchrow_hashref;

        my $form = CGI::FormBuilder->new(
                        method => 'POST',
                        fields => [qw/name email phone gender/],
                        values => $dbval,
                        validate => { email => 'EMAIL', phone => 'PHONE' },
                        required => 'ALL',
                   );

        # Change gender field to have options
        $form->field(name => 'gender', options => [qw/Male Female/]);

        if ($form->submitted && $form->validate) {
            my $fields = $form->field;    # get form fields as hashref

            # Do something to update your data (you would write this)
            do_data_update($fields->{name}, $fields->{email},
                           $fields->{phone}, $fields->{gender});

            print $form->confirm(header => 1);  # confirmation screen

            $form->mailconfirm(to => $fields->{email});

        } else {
            print $form->render(header => 1);   # print out the form
        }

    That simple bit of code would print out an entire form, laid out in a
    table, complete with JavaScript validation code. Default values would be
    filled in from the DBI hashref. It would also handle stickiness across
    multiple submissions correctly. It will also be able to tell if it's
    been submitted, and do server-side validation too.

    Overall, I just plain hate form generation and validation because the
    majority of the process is tedious and mindless. FormBuilder tries to
    get rid of the stoopid parts.

WHY USE FORMBUILDER?
    There are a lot of form modules, scripts, etc out there. So why use this
    one? Well, that's up to you, but here are the features that I feel are
    the real benefits of FormBuilder:

  DWIMmery
    This module tries to "Do What I Mean". Tell it the fields you care
    about, and it takes care of all the stupid HTML and JavaScript
    generation and processing for you. It also gives you back the correct
    values that you want. It will even label your fields automatically.

  Input field abstraction
    You simply define your fields and their values, and this module will
    take care of figuring out what representation is best. It will then
    generate the appropriate input fields (input, select, radio, etc), even
    changing any JavaScript actions appropriately.

  Easy handling of defaults
    Just specify a hash of values to use as the defaults for your fields.
    This will be searched case-insensitively and displayed in the form.
    What's more, if the user enters something via the CGI that overrides a
    default, when you use the "field()" method to get the data you'll get
    the correct value.

  Correct stickiness
    Stickiness is a PITA. FormBuilder correctly handles even multiple values
    selected in a multiple select list, integrated with proper handling of
    defaults.

  Robust field validation
    Form validation sucks, and this is where FormBuilder is a big help. It
    has tons of builtin patterns, and will even generate gobs of JavaScript
    validation code for you. You can specify your own regexps as well, and
    FormBuilder will correctly check even multivalued inputs.

  Multiple submit mode support
    FormBuilder allows you to reliably tell whether the person clicked on
    the "Update" or "Delete" button of your form, normally a big pain.

  Template driver support
    FormBuilder can natively "drive" both major templating engines,
    "HTML::Template" and "Template Toolkit". If you want to build a form
    application with a template in less that 20 lines of Perl, FormBuilder
    is for you.

INSTALLATION
    Installation is standard, the same way as for other Perl modules.

SUPPORT
    There is a website devoted to this module at www.formbuilder.org which
    has tutorials, code examples, full documentation, and much more!
